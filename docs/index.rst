Common Total Defense Login Problems
------------------------------------

Sometimes users face login issues even when they believe their credentials are correct. Here are some common causes and solutions.

Incorrect Email Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you are using the same email address that was used during registration or purchase. Many login errors happen due to typing mistakes or using a different email.

Caps Lock Enabled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Passwords are case sensitive. If the caps lock key is turned on, your password may not match.

Browser Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes browser settings or extensions interfere with login pages. You can try:

- Clearing browser cache  
- Disabling extensions temporarily  
- Using a different browser  
- Opening the site in private browsing mode  

Account Not Activated

If you recently purchased a subscription, ensure that your account activation email has been confirmed. Without verification, login access may be limited.

Logging into your antivirus account on unsecured public networks can expose your credentials to hackers.
